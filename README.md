## This project demonstrates the use of Pick a Card game
### Instructions:
#### 1. Declare two data members value as (integer) and suit as (String) in Card class
#### 2. Have getter and setter methods for both value and suit variable.
#### 3. In CardTrick class import random package and apply random function on values and suits in "hand" of seven card array
#### 4. Create Scanner object to input value and suit of a card and validate that. If not then again pick it.
#### 5. Create a uCard object to store the value and suit entered by user of a card.
#### 6. Then take a boolean variable to check the condition with initial value false.
#### 7. Use for loop for magicHand array and check if user card exactly matches with random card . If it matches then number is true and it terminates the checking.
#### 8. If a number equals true then you will win otherwise lose.
#### 9. Alternatively, you can make luckyCard object and input any value and suit mentioned in array respectively. Compare lucky card with random card if compared winning moment otherwise losing.
